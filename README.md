# AgentChain 

# Introduction
AgentChain uses LLM as a central thinking agent to orchestrate multiple tools to achieve high level multi modal tasks. 

Given a task, AgentChain will first identify the task type and then select the best tool/tools to execute the task.

AgentChain is able to receive text, image or audio as input, execute intelligent tasks and return multi modal output.
